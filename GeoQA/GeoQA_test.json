Solution: Because CE || BD and DE || AC, therefore quadrilateral CODE is a parallelogram. Quadrilateral ABCD is a rectangle, therefore AC = BD = 4, OA = OC, OB = OD, therefore OD = OC, AC = √{AB² + BC²} = √{4² + 3²} = 5. Therefore, quadrilateral CODE is a rhombus, and OC = 1/2 AC = 2.5.

Because in rectangle ABCD, AB = 4, BC = 2, point M is on BC, ∠AMN = ∠AMB, therefore AC = 2√5, AD ∥ BC, therefore ∠DAM = ∠AMB, thus ∠DAM = ∠AMN, therefore △AMN is an isosceles triangle, thus AN = MN, AH = MH. Because ∠ABM = ∠NHM = 90°, ∠AMB = ∠NMH, therefore △ABM ∼ △NHM, therefore BM/HM = AM/MN, thus BM•MN = AM•HM. Since point M is on side BC, AM = 2HM, therefore the maximum value of AM is AM = AC, at this time AM = 2√5, therefore the maximum value of BM•MN is: 2√5 • √5 = 10. Since MN = AN, therefore the maximum value of BM•AN is 10. Hence, the answer is: B."
